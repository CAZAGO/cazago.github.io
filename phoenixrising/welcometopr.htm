Nestled in the heart of the Arizona Sonoran Desert, our festival is headquartered at the luxurious Arizona Biltmore Resort &amp; Spa, a member of the Waldorf-Astoria Collection. Known throughout the world as the<i> Jewel of the Desert,</i> the Arizona Biltmore Resort &amp; Spa has long been a favorite of celebrities and U.S. presidents providing a restful oasis of thirty-nine acres covered with lush gardens, glistening swimming pools, and Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced architecture.</font></p>							<p><font size="4" color="white">Since hosting the <i>Summer SoundSplash '95</i> Regional Convention, the Phoenix metroplex has added or expanded over twenty new instruments and Phoenix has become the fifth largest city in the nation. Performances will include organists of international standing on instruments large and small, of mechanical and electric action. Workshops will be led by champions of their fields, with options for the advanced academic or the beginning student, the amateur or the aficionado of the art. Choral and handbell elements will round out the opportunities for the sacred musician in an atmosphere of education and inspiration. </font></p>							<p><font size="4" color="white">While regional events are often termed as conventions, the steering committee of Phoenix Rising has coined our event as a <i>festival</i>! This is a time to celebrate the organ, sacred music, academic research, virtuosity, musicality, collegiality, diversity, and all that makes our field and the American Guild of Organists so spectacular!</font></p>							<p><font size="4" color="white">Festival hotel rates are available prior to and following the festival, providing an opportunity to explore the beauty and wonder of Arizona. Come, feel the heat, and catch the fire in a land traversed by Coronado in 1540. Come, experience the spirit of our land, our history, and join those who pioneer for excellence. Come, meet friends old and new and let this be an opportunity for renewal and relaxation.</font></p>							<p><font size="4" color="white">Very truly yours,</font></p>							<p><font size="4" color="white">Dr. Homer A.
