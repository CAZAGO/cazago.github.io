The thermometer can register daytime temperatures as high as 110&#150;115F degrees during June, but the relative humidity is usually below 10%, with the result of feeling cooler than it actually is. More than four million people live in the metro area year-round, and love it, and here's how they do it: (and you can do it too!)</font></p>							<p><font size="3" color="white">Drink LOTS of water! Health officials recommend that everyone here drink at least one gallon of water every day during the hot season. Our Phoenix Rising Committee has arranged for plenty of bottled water be available throughout the Festival Venues, and it will be supplied at no cost to you. (The water, not the committee).</font></p>							<p><font size="3" color="white">Wear cotton or other cool clothing. We're all pretty casual in the Valley of the Sun, so, walking shorts, short-sleeved shirts, sandals, and hats or caps that offer some shade are the unofficial daytime uniform here. The nighttime temperature can get down to a chilly 85 degrees during June, and the churches, halls, and buses are air-conditioned, so you may want to consider warmer (relatively speaking, of course) evening wear.</font></p>							<p><font size="3" color="white">Slap on the sun screen! The midday summer sun can be brutal to anyone not used to its powerful rays, and even exposure for a few minutes can cause some people to burn. And, don't forget the sunglasses!</font></p>							<p><font size="3" color="white">Move a little slower, at least while you&#146;re here! Take this opportunity to relax and rejuvenate your spirit and body, while experiencing a wealth of fantastic musical, educational events, and camaraderie at <i>Phoenix Rising.</i> Take some time to enjoy one of the Biltmore's eight swimming pools, or their spa, or the on campus golf course&#151;the sky is light and bright by 5:30 </font><font size="2" color="white">AM</font><font size="3" color="white"> during June. In fact, why not come a day or two early, and stay a couple of days after the Festival, just to enjoy this <i>Jewel of the Desert!</i> After all, we promise that this will be the hottest time you'll ever have!</font></p>							<p></p>						</blockquote>					</div>					<div align="center">						<blockquote>							<blockquote>								<p><b><font color="#48d1cc"> </font></b></p>							</blockquote>							<blockquote>								<p><font color="white"></font></p>							</blockquote>						</blockquote>					</div>				</td>			</tr>		</table>	</body></html>
