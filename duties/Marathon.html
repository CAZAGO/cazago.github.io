Set date for the recital after consulting the board, being sure to check the ASU recital schedule, the Sun City Symphony Schedule and American Lutheran Church of Sun City's schedule.</p>					<p><br/>					</p>					<p>2. Find three locations and willing organists to host the afternoon of recitals. All marathon recitals are to be performed on pipe organs as agreed on by the Executive Board.</p>					<p><br/>					</p>					<p>3. Write several articles for the Pipeline to encourage participation and support. Try to get volunteers before recruiting. But be prepared to do some recruiting, it will be a very unusual year if you don't have to.</p>					<p><br/>					</p>					<p>4. Encourage the host organists to recruit their participants, which can also include choirs, an instrumentalist or vocalist. All performers need to schedule their personal practice times with their respective host organist not with the marathom coordinator.</p>					<p><br/>					</p>					<p>5. Set a standard for good quality music if asked. Concerts should be sacred or classical music, no pop music.</p>					<p><br/>					</p>					<p>6. After getting a list of perspective performers in the fall, talk to them at meetings etc. and get them excited about the idea. After Christmas, call them and remind them, and get a firm commitment from them. Find out if there is a problem with any time as far as scheduling is concerned.</p>					<p><br/>					</p>					<p>7. Talk to the host organists every week or two after Christmas and help them with recruiting or anything else they need to get their performance schedules set up .Usually each host organist sets their own schedule but sometimes will prefer the marathon coordinator to do it for them. Also if an organist performs at more than one location, the marathoon coorcinator needs to work with the host organists to figure it out the best times.</p>					<p><br/>					</p>					<p>8. Be a troubleshooter incase any personal problems or misunderstanding occur between a host organist or a performer.</p>					<p><br/>					</p>					<p>9. Set a deadline for recital programs and short bios to be Emailed or mailed to you. Usually it is two weeks before the program. Collect all the programs from all performers. This will involve several reminder calls and Emails. After you have received them all assemble them into a booklet, using last years's program as a model. Turn that into the typist in person and show him or her exactly what you want. Proofread the programs with another organist before they are printed. Be sure the printer gets them in time. Pick them up from the printer and contact the host organists and get them their programs on the day before the marathon.</p>					<p><br/>					</p>					<p>10. Work with the publicity person to announce it on KBAQ and the Phoenix Papers. Each host organist will handle the publicity for his or her own area of town.</p>					<p><br/>					</p>					<p>11. Encourage each host organist to make fliers for their marathom and give to each performer to distribute.</p>					<p><br/>					</p>					<p>12. After the marathon is over, transmit all donations to the AGO treasurer to go for the Organ Scholarship Fund.</p>				</div>			</blockquote>		</div></body></html>
