That sounded a little weird to me, even at that age, and soon found out it was recorder lessons. I rode my bike to the lessons in Riverside, California. Pretty soon the same neighbors got tired of me always being at their house playing their piano. So mom and dad got me a piano and I started piano lessons at about age eight.&nbsp;I was playing the piano in the orchestra in Junior High in Claremont, California. One day the conductor asked if anyone would like to learn to play the cello because he was short on cellists. I raised my hand and that got me started in my cello career. The biggest problem with playing the cello at that time was that girls still weren't allowed to wear pants to school and our skirts were short. I often played cello side-saddle!<br>									 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continued to study both piano and cello through high school in New Jersey. We lived very close to New York City so the musical opportunities were unlimited. I played with many long-term and short-term groups and organizations, including special performances with the New Jersey Symphony. I hauled my cello to Brigham Young University and was admitted into the Philharmonic Orchestra; I continued private cello lessons. But not being satisfied with knowing how to play three instruments, I started organ lessons. I only had enough time left to take about three semesters before graduation. But it was enough to become competent to play for church for the next twenty or so years while we raised three daughters.<br>									 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We moved to Las Vegas after the kids were all grown up and after attending an AGO sponsored recital, I turned to my husband and said &quot;I'm going to take organ lessons again.&quot; I studied with Paul Hesselink for about six-and-a-half years and am currently working with Kenneth Udy in Salt Lake City. And now we have a 12-rank pipe organ in our home. My dream is to sit at the organ bench 24/7 and not be responsible for anything else.</font></p>							<p><a name="kcook"></a><font color="white"><b><a href="images/personalities/cook.jpg"onclick="window.open('images/personalities/cook.jpg', '_blank', 'width=324,height=447'); return false">Kay Cook</a></b> is internationally recognized as a leader in the development of virtuoso handbell choirs.

She then studied with Marcel Dupr&eacute; and Rolande Falcinelli at Fontainebleau, France. After several years of travel and concerts she became organist-choirmaster of the American Church, Rome, Italy. A visiting Yale Professor heard her play and offered a scholarship to Yale Graduate Music School. She performed her Master's Recital at Woolsey Hall and received the Jepson Award for outstanding work. Her father's death a few months later changed her life forever. She abandoned the organ, attended Pre-Med classes at Columbia University Night School, New York, and worked on Wall Street during the day. She was admitted to The University of Oklahoma School of Medicine at age thirty-three, and received her Doctor of Medicine degree in 1969. After four years of post-grad Residency training at Huntington Hospital, Pasadena, and Los Angeles County General Hospital, she practiced Internal Medicine for thirty years in Pasadena. She retired from medical practice in 2000, relocated to Las Vegas, and resumed organ playing in 2003. She performed on <i>Pipe Dreams Live from Las Vegas</i> at the Region IX Mid-Winter Conclave Jan '06, and gave her 75th Birthday recital at the University of Nevada Las Vegas a few months later. She has personal experience with the problems of <i>Performing in the Golden Years,</i> and will share insights with workshop participants.</font></p>							<p><a name="robb"></a><font color="white"><a href="images/personalities/robb.jpg"onclick="window.open('images/personalities/robb.jpg', '_blank', 'width=304,height=448'); return false"><b>Leslie Wolf Robb</b></a> fell in love with the organ at age seven after hearing a Hammond B-3 in the organ bar at a San Diego restaurant. Her parents were not immediately convinced of the need for a home organ (Dad pushed for a piano&#151;you could rent those!) and didn't capitulate to their only child's demands until just before her eighth Christmas, when they purchased a lovely Hammond L-100 spinet. After one lesson they spent the holidays enjoying <i>Silent Night</i> and <i>Long, Long Ago.</i> The spinet (and her mother&#146;s Duncan Phyfe dining room set) gave way to a console organ (still a Hammond) in junior high and classical organ studies began in high school, when the <i>pop</i> organ teacher sent Leslie on to study with local church organist Frank Kueter. Teaching and playing for church began shortly thereafter and she's not tired of them yet. She received her bachelor of arts in music from San Diego State University where she studied organ with John Kuzma and Kenneth Fall, and has done extensive graduate work in keyboard pedagogy there as well, studying piano with Mitzi Kolar. She earned her CAGO in 1978 and was awarded a D.H. Baldwin Fellowship in 1986. Leslie has served as Organist and Director of Music of St. Paul's Lutheran Church and School in San Diego since 1985 and teaches piano and organ to both children and adults. Her students are frequent award winners in competitions and perform regularly in the San Diego area. She has served on the board of San Diego AGO in many capacities, was Dean from 2001&#150;2003, and co-chaired the 1999 Regional Convention. Currently she chairs the San Diego AGO Education Committee and serves as editor for the chapter newsletter. Leslie served as director of National AGO's <i>Committee on Regional Conventions</i> from 2002&#150;2005 and now serves on the <i>Committee on Regional Competitions for Young Organists.</i> She has presented workshops on teaching young organists at the local, regional, and national levels. Her materials for organ instruction are published by Wayne Leupold Editions. She has been fortunate to make a good living in her music career and has not had to resort to bank robbery (as did the young man who inspired her interest in organ as he played the Hammond B-3 in the organ bar all those years ago!).</font></p>							<p><a name="samuel"></a><font color="white"><b><a href="images/personalities/samuel.jpg"onclick="window.open('images/personalities/samuel.jpg', '_blank', 'width=351,height=448'); return false">Christopher Samuel</a> &#150; </b>a native of Virginia, attended James Madison University, the Royal School of Church Music, and Westminster Choir College, from which he received the Bachelor of Church Music and the Master of Music in Choral Conducting degrees.
