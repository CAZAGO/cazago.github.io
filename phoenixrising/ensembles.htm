They have sung at the invitations of the Archbishops of Milan, Salzburg, Florence, Siena, Perugia, Sorrento, Venice, Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Hradec Kralove, Santander, Santiago de Compostela, Toledo, and Sevilla, presenting concerts in each of those cathedrals, and have performed in the great basilicas across Europe. The Choir was honored to have been sponsored by the Pontificio Instituto di Musica Sacra and Amici Della Musica Sacra in Italy presenting a series of concerts in Rome, including the <i>Mass of the Angels</i> at the Basilica Church of St. Peter at Vatican City, and a private devotional concert in the Sistine Chapel. The Choir was pleased to have been selected as one of four American Church Choirs to participate in the first Salzburg Church Music Festival to highlight American Sacred Music, in the summer of 1987.  They are well known for their versatility in performing literature from many periods, particularly music of the twentieth century. In addition to providing music for the regular worship services of Central Church, they present major works with chamber orchestra, Broadway musicals, yearly community concerts, and have appeared on Central Church's weekly television program. They have performed on numerous occasions with <i>The Phoenix Symphony</i> and have performed for festivals, both regional and national conventions of the American Choral Directors Association, the Music Educators National Conference, the American Guild of Organists, and United Methodist Denominational gatherings. A volunteer choir, they are comprised of professionals in many career areas whose common interest is serious music making in sacred settings.</font></p>							<p><b><font size="4"><font color="#48d1cc">&#149;</font> </font><font size="4" color="white"><a href="http://www.valleychamberchorale.com/" target="_blank">Valley Chamber Chorale</a></font></b><font size="4" color="white"><br>								</font><font color="white"><b>Christopher Samuel,</b> <i>Director<br>																														 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Building on a nucleus of singers who were graduates of the Paradise Valley High School Concert Choir, the Chorale invited Christopher Samuel in 1988 to become conductor and artistic director, and expanded into a community choir that included members from all parts of the Valley. Ultimately reorganizing as an auditioned chamber choir under a not-for-profit status, the group eventually took the name <i>Valley Chamber Chorale</i> in order to reflect the breadth of the area communities represented by its members. Since 1988, the ensemble has performed at the state convention of  the Music Educators National Conference in 1991 and 1995, the American Guild of Organists Region IX Convention, <i>Summer Soundsplash '95 (</i>in Phoenix), and the <i>World's Largest Organ Concert</i> with guest artist, Joan Lippincott, in 1996. The group's compact disc of Renaissance motets and madrigals, <i>O Sing Joyfully,</i> was released in 1996, and can be found in bookstores locally and in select cities nationally.</font></p>							<p><b><font size="4"><font color="#48d1cc">&#149;</font> </font><font size="4" color="white"><a href="http://www.desertbells.org/index.html" target="_blank">Bronzeworks Handbell Choir</a></font></b><font size="4" color="white"><br>								</font><font color="white"><b>Kay Cook, </b><i>Director</i><b><i><br>																																												 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b><i>Bronzeworks</i>&#153; is a performance/touring group comprised of teen ringers, ages twelve to nineteen. These ringers have advanced from Junior Bronzeworks, or successfully auditioned for acceptance. <i>Bronzeworks</i> ringers have developed the advanced musical ringing skills required to execute highly complex rhythms and musical arrangements for stage and theater performances. Members must be relatively flexible with regard to their schedule and be able to travel throughout the United States and internationally when the group is booked for performance or recording engagements. There are approximately ten to fifteen performances and/or recording commitments each year in addition to two to four out of town engagements each year. International tours are usually booked in the summer every two years. <i>Bronzeworks</i> is well known throughout the world for their accurately synchronized musical ringing, technical dexterity, and creative interpretation of musical compositions and their delightfully entertaining style and showmanship on stage. They have been featured many times throughout the years on all the local Arizona television stations. Most recently, Channel 12 and Sean McLaughlin, featured <i>Bronzeworks</i> during the second week of competition at the 2002 Winter Olympics, as they performed at various venues throughout Park City and the Olympic Village and on the nationally syndicated <i>Today Show.</i> In December of 2000, <i>Bronzeworks</i> performed in the production of <i>Christmas Pudding</i> at the Celebrity Theater, in conjunction with several national celebrities. <i>Bronzeworks</i> introduces newly published works to the musical community. Their recording, <i>Bronzeworks &#145;95,</i> features a variety of original compositions and some familiar favorites like <i>Boogie</i> <i>Woogie Bugle Boy</i> and <i>Battle Hymn of the Republic.</i> Red River Publishing recently announced they were planning to publish a series of CDs dedicated to the performances of <i>Bronzeworks</i>.
